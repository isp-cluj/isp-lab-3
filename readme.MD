# Implement the following exercises:

## Exercise 1

A class Tree contains:
- One instance variable 'height' (of type int) representing the height of tree;
- One default constructor which initialize the height to 15;
- One grow(int meters) method which add to the current height the meters given as long as meters >= 1;
- One toString() method which returns the height of the tree;
   
1. Write a class which models the class Tree. 
2. Create a tree object and call all his methods and print out the values(in main)
3. Write a class TreeTest which test the Tree class. You have to write three tests:
    * for grow(int meters) method
    * for toString() method
    * for the default constructor

## Exercise 2

A class called Rectangle contains:
- Three private instance variables: length (of type int) width(of type int) and color (of type String), with default value of 2, 1 and “red”, respectively.
- One overloaded constructor which sets the length and the width;
- One overloaded constructor which sets the length, the width and the colors;
- Five public methods: getLength(), getWidth(), getColor(), getPerimeter() and getArea().

1. Write a class which models the class Rectangle.
2. Create a rectangle object and call all his methods and print out the values(in main)
3. Write a class RectangleTest which test Rectangle class.
    * write tests for every constructor and for every method
