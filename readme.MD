# Implement the following exercises:

1) A class Tree contains:
   
   One instance variable 'height' (of type int) representing the height of tree;
   One default constructor which initialize the height to 15;
   One grow(int meters) method which add to the current height the meters given as long as meters >= 1;
   One toString() method which returns the height of the tree;
   
   Write a class which models the class Tree. 
   Write a class TreeTest which test the Tree class.
   	you have to write three tests:
   		-for grow(int meters) method
   		-for toString() method
   		-for the default constructor
   Create a tree object and call all his methods and print out the values(in main)
